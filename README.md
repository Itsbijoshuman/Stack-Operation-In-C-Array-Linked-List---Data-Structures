This repository Has the C Code for Stack Operations.
 I Have Tried to Implement Push , POP , Peek/TOP 
 
 Validations :
 
 I have Tried Adding Every Single Validation Possible. Validations Include - Menu Options Validation , Advance Input Validation , Checks Overflow And UnderFlow .
 
 Here Is the Outer Menu : 
 
              Where do You want to Create Stack In ?
                   1. Array
                   2. Linked List

                        3.) Check Underflow
                        4.) Print The Present Stack
                        5.) Peek/Top
                        6.) Exit To Outer Menu

Note : This is a terminal based basic program so don't have higher expectations from the code :)
    Happy Coding !
